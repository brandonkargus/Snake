# Snake

Simple retro game influenced by cellphone games of the late '90s, with some added features.

*heavily influenced by this YouTube tutorial by "Bro Code" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ)

## Requirements

Created using Java Swing GUI toolkit.  You will need Java 1.2 or greater (I used Java 11).

*note, use A(left), W(up), S(down), D(right) on keyboard to control snake.

## Hints
- background color is randomized each round
- reach a score of 20 for a "special" snake!
